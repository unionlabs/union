/// ExistenceProof takes a key and a value and a set of steps to perform on it.
/// The result of performing all these steps will provide a "root hash", which can
/// be compared to the value in a header.
///
/// Since it is computationally infeasible to produce a hash collission for any of the used
/// cryptographic hash functions, if someone can provide a series of operations to transform
/// a given key and value into a root hash that matches some trusted root, these key and values
/// must be in the referenced merkle tree.
///
/// The only possible issue is maliablity in LeafOp, such as providing extra prefix data,
/// which should be controlled by a spec. Eg. with lengthOp as NONE,
/// prefix = FOO, key = BAR, value = CHOICE
/// and
/// prefix = F, key = OOBAR, value = CHOICE
/// would produce the same value.
///
/// With LengthOp this is tricker but not impossible. Which is why the "leafPrefixEqual" field
/// in the ProofSpec is valuable to prevent this mutability. And why all trees should
/// length-prefix the data before hashing it.
