In a move to further interoperability and privacy in the blockchain space, Secret Network has chosen to form a partnership with Union. This collaboration marks a significant step forward for both projects, promising to enhance efficiency, security, and trustlessness in cross-chain transactions.

Secret Network has selected Union as its IBC interoperability layer. This decision reflects Union's commitment to fostering trustless and secure transfers across blockchain networks. By leveraging Union's technology, Secret Network ensures the highest standards of security and privacy.

To aid Secret on its journey towards Privacy-as-a-Service, Union will be providing zkIBC connections via light clients. Union's light clients enable Secret Network to eliminate the need for centralization in facilitating secure transactions. This integration ensures seamless message passing and private interoperability, setting the stage for enhanced privacy features within the Secret Network ecosystem.

By partnering with innovative projects like Secret Network, Union drives the vision of unstoppable cross-chain connections. This collaborative approach enhances interoperability and reduces reliance on centralized entities, empowering individuals with greater control over their financial assets and personal data.
