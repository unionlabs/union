title: Distributed Validator Tech

import Mermaid from "#/components/Mermaid.astro";

We can scale the validator set using [distributed validator tech](https://figment.io/distributed-validator-technology-and-infrastructure-resilience/) (DVT) even more, allowing the Union network to effectively support thousands of validators.
The foundation for this scaling is once again [BLS signatures](/docs/concepts/bls-signatures), which allows us to aggregate signed votes in smaller steps:

<Mermaid
  content={`
    erDiagram
      Galois }|--|| Union : proves
      Validator }|--|| Union : "transitions state"
      DVT-1 }|..|| Validator : shards
      DVT-2 }|..|| Validator : shards
      DVT-3 }|..|| Validator : shards
  `}
/>

The network can handle a hybrid set of regular and distributed validators, and recursively expand the DVT set without incurring any extra cost on the consensus or prover.
