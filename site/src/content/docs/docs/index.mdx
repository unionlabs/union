The Union network is a hyper-efficient zero-knowledge infrastructure layer for general message passing, asset transfers, NFTs, and DeFi. It's based on consensus verification and has no dependencies on trusted third parties, oracles, multi-signatures, or [MPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation).

## Who is Union built for?

For those who care about decentralization and reliability, and believe that finance should be accessible for everyone.

### Core Values

Union is developed to be a scalable powerhouse:

- Fast: bridging transactions are generated and settled quickly.
- Secure: abide by fork-choice rules.
- Future proof: core tech is built for the next decennium.
- Easy to use: high-level API usable for developers from any ecosystem.
