Enabling IBC for Solidity contracts has never been easier. We provide a
simple interface for IBC Channel/Packet lifecycle that protocols must implement
in order to open channels, send and receive packets.

:::danger

Contracts MUST use an **onlyIBC** modifier for IBC callbacks. This modifier ensures that the caller is the IBC handler contract.

:::

[The interface is following the official IBC ICS26 specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/2921c5cec7b18e4ef77677e16a6b693051ae3b35/spec/core/ics-026-routing-module/README.md)

<EmbedCodeSnippet
  filepath="../../../evm/contracts/core/05-port/IIBCModule.sol"
  filename="IIBCModule.sol"
  language="solidity"
/>

On top of this interface, we also provide an abstract contract that we recommend to use.

:::note

An example implementation is available [in the Solidity demo.](/docs/demos/pingpong/)
