title: "Configuring the Union Client"
---

The initial step to start communicating with Union through IBC is to have a light client. Light clients are used for verifying the consensus and storage of a counterparty
chain in a low-cost, high-performance manner. Because they require very little computation power, and storage units compared to a full node, these algorithms can be implemented
on-chain. The `CometBLS` light client is used for tracking `Union`'s consensus. Apart from the traditional light clients, it uses ZK verification to make the consensus
verification even more cost-effective. 

We have various `CometBLS` light client implementations meant to be run on different chains:

## Cosmos SDK-based chains

Up until the recent release of [the wasm light clients](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/blog/wasm-client), the traditional way of having a light client on a Cosmos-SDK chain was
to implement a light client with Go and bundle it with the chain which meant modifying the light client code requires a binary upgrade to the chain. After IBC proved its capability
to be extended into other platforms, [the wasm light client module](https://www.ibcprotocol.dev/blog/wasm-client) is introduced for chains to be able to easily, deploy and modify
light clients. For this very reason, our go-to solution is to use the `CometBLS wasm light client`.

### Integrating `08-wasm` module to your chain

There is pretty extensive documentation on how to do this on [the official docs](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/integration/). Before diving into this
documentation, note that the `08-wasm` module requires your chain to be on `IBC-go` v7 or v8. And also note that adding this module will also add the dependency to [libwasmvm](https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm)
to your chain which is already there if you are already using [CosmWasm](https://github.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm).

### Adding CometBLS light client

The wasm light client module is permissioned through governance. So storing a contract requires you to submit a `store-code` proposal. You can check [this part](https://ibc.cosmos.network/v8/ibc/light-clients/wasm/governance/) of the
official docs but we also summarized the steps for you to keep it easy.

1. Download the latest `CometBLS` light client:
```bash
wget https://github.com/unionlabs/union/releases/download/v0.24.0/cometbls-light-client.wasm
```

2. Submit a proposal to store the `CometBLS` light client:
```bash
$NODE_BIN tx ibc-wasm store-code cometbls-light-client.wasm --title "Upload CometBLS Wasm client" --summary "Upload CometBLS Wasm client" --deposit 100000$DENOM --from $VALIDATOR --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2
```

3. Deposit to the proposal:
```bash
$NODE_BIN tx gov deposit $PROPOSAL_ID 1000000000$DENOM --from $VALIDATOR --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2
```

4. Make sure enough validators vote `yes`:
```bash
$NODE_BIN tx gov vote "$prop_id" yes --from $VALIDATOR -y --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2
```

After the proposal passes, you will see the stored light client's checksum by using this query:

```bash
$NODE_BIN query ibc-wasm checksums
```
