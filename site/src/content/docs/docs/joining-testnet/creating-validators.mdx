Before trying to create a validator, ensure you have the following task complete:

- Initialized your node
- Completed our intake form
- Received UNO tokens
- Started your node
- Ensured your node has caught up to the networks current height

Once all of these tasks are finished, you can continue with creating your validator.

## How Delegations Will Work

To ensure quick update cycles of the testnet, we ask that you only have a self delegation of 1 UNO. The Union team will delegate more to you to ensure you and the other validators have a similar delegation. This will enable us to maintain the majority of the total voting power so that we can quickly conduct updates to the network.

As we get closer to a mainnet release, we will update staking and slashing parameters and ask for more realistic self delegations. For the meantime, we will ensure to testnet is configured to change quickly with minimum friction.

## Creating your validator

Now that you're ready to create your validator, you can follow the steps below:

1. Create a `validator.json`

Create a file with the following content:

```json
{
	"pubkey": <PUBKEY>,
	"amount": "1000000muno",
	"moniker": "<MONIKER>",
	"identity": "optional identity signature (ex. UPort or Keybase)",
	"website": "validator's (optional) website",
	"security": "validator's (optional) security contact email",
	"details": "validator's (optional) details",
	"commission-rate": "0.1",
	"commission-max-rate": "0.2",
	"commission-max-change-rate": "0.01",
	"min-self-delegation": "1"
}
```

Replacing:

- `<PUBKEY>` with the result of running `uniond comet show-validator`
- `<MONIKER>` with your moniker
- And the optional content with your preferred details

2. Run the `create-validator` command

Then you can submit this file using the `create-validator` sub-command:

```sh
uniond tx staking create-validator $VALIDATOR_JSON_PATH --from $KEY_NAME --chain-id union-testnet-5
```

_Where `VALIDATOR_JSON_PATH` is the path to your `validator.json`_

:::caution

If you're running a node with a Docker container, your `validator.json` will need to be in a folder accessible by your Docker container.

If you've followed our instructions for setting up either of our Docker images, you should be able to place this file under `.unionvisor` (for Unionvisor containers) or under `.union` (for union-release containers).

:::note

If your own node isn't set up to accept RPC request, you can send them to another node via the `--node` option. See our [Public Endpoints](../public-endpoints) page for more information.
