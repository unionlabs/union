Unionvisor is a utility for managing `uniond` deployments. It manages running, upgrading, and interacting with the node.

## Obtaining Unionvisor

We release container images of Unionvisor called bundles. Each bundle contains everything required for running Unionvisor and joining a particular network. The Unionvisor bundle for `union-testnet-5` is `bundle-testnet-5`. You can obtain the Unionvisor bundle for `union-testnet-5` from our [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/unionlabs/packages/container/package/bundle-testnet-5).

Alternatively, you can run the following command:

```sh
export UNIONVISOR_VERSION='v0.18.0'
docker pull ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-5:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION
```

## Running Unionvisor

Before running this image, we need to create a folder to host the chain configuration and state.

You can create this wherever you would like, but we'll be doing so in our current user's home directory.

:::caution

It's important that you will be able to edit this contents of this folder.

:::

To create a directory for `unionvisor` in your user home directory, run:

```sh
mkdir ~/.unionvisor
```

### Initializing the Chain Config & State Folder

Now, using the `unionvisor` image and the folder we just created, we can initialize the contents of this folder.

To do this, we'll be using Docker volumes.

```sh
docker run -v ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor -v /tmp:/tmp -it ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-4:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION init --moniker $MONIKER --network union-testnet-5 --seeds "8a07752a234bb16471dbb577180de7805ba6b5d9@union.testnet.4.seed.poisonphang.com:26656"
```

_Where `MONIKER` is the preferred moniker you'd like to use on this node._

:::note

Note the usage of the flags and arguments we pass to `docker run` run here:

- `-v ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor` mounts the folder we created to the `/.unionvisor` folder of the container
- `-it` ensures we are running the container interactively

:::

After the `uniond init` command is done running, you should have a `.union` folder with the following contents:

```
~/.unionvisor
├── home
│  ├── config
│  │  ├── app.toml
│  │  ├── client.toml
│  │  ├── config.toml
│  │  ├── genesis.json
│  │  ├── node_key.json
│  │  └── priv_validator_key.json
│  └── data
│      └── priv_validator_state.json
└── uniond -> /versions/v0.14.0/uniond
```

### Migrating an Existing Node (Optional)

If you have an existing node, either from running the `uniond` image or raw binary - you can migrate it to Unionvisor starting here.

To migrate, you only need to copy over your `uniond` state into the `~/.unionvisor/home` directory - then start Unionvisor normally.

If you have a `uniond` state saved to `~/.union`, you can run the following command.

```sh
sudo cp -r ~/.union/* ~/.unionvisor/home
```

Then continue to follow the guide normally.

:::note

We use `sudo` here because Docker created the files we are copying with elevated permissions.

:::

### Issuing Sub-Commands to uniond via Unionvisor

To run `uniond` sub-commands, it will be useful to alias the Docker command in your shell `.*rc` file.

For example, in `zsh`, you can add the following alias to your `.zshrc`:

```sh
export UNIONVISOR_VERSION='v0.18.0'
alias uniond='docker run -v ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor -v /tmp:/tmp --network host -it ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-4:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION call'
```

:::note

- The `unionvisor call` sub-command passes commands and arguments to `uniond`.
- You may wish to pass `--log-level off` when calling Unionvisor to prevent extra output while issuing sub-commands.

:::

This will enable you to issue `uniond` sub-commands with such as `uniond keys add` with ease.

### Starting the Node

To run a node using Unionvisor, you'll also need to expose ports to the container. We'll use this as an opportunity to create a Docker Compose file four Unionvisor.

A minimal Docker Compose file for Unionvisor looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-4:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION
    volumes:
      - ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor
      - /tmp:/tmp
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: run --poll-interval 1000
```

:::note

You only need to mount `/tmp` if you intend to use [State Sync](../state-sync) to join the network

:::

This will mount our chain configuration and settings folder while also exposing ports `26657`, `1317`, and `9093`.

After creating a `compose.yml` file with the contents above, you'll be able to start your Union node with `docker compose`.

:::warning

Before starting your Union node for the first time, you should configure your node correctly.

For some configuration recommendations see our [Node Configuration](/infrastructure/node-operators/node-configuration) page.

:::

To run your node in detached mode, run:

```sh
docker compose -f path/to/compose.yaml up -d
```
