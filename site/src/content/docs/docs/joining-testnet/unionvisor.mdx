Unionvisor is a utility for managing `uniond` deployments. It manages running, upgrading, and interacting with the node.

## Obtaining Unionvisor

We release container images of Unionvisor called bundles. Each bundle contains everything required for running Unionvisor and joining a particular network. The Unionvisor bundle for `union-testnet-6` is `bundle-testnet-6`. You can obtain the Unionvisor bundle for `union-testnet-6` from our [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/unionlabs/packages/container/package/bundle-testnet-6).

Alternatively, you can run the following command:

```sh frame="none"
docker pull ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-6:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION
```

_Where `UNIONVISOR_VERSION` is <Version chainId="union-testnet-6" genesis="false"/>_

## Running Unionvisor

Before running this image, we need to create a folder to host the chain configuration and state.

You can create this wherever you would like, but we'll be doing so in our current user's home directory.

:::caution

It's important that you will be able to edit this contents of this folder.

:::

To create a directory for `unionvisor` in your user home directory, run:

```sh frame="none"
mkdir ~/.unionvisor
```

### Initializing the Chain Config & State Folder

Now, using the `unionvisor` image and the folder we just created, we can initialize the contents of this folder.

To do this, we'll be using Docker volumes.

```sh frame="none"
docker run \
  --volume ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor \
  --volume /tmp:/tmp \
  -it ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-6:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION \
  init --moniker $MONIKER \
  --network union-testnet-6 \
  --seeds "b37de4c50e26f7cde4c7b6ce06046a6693ffef2c@union.testnet.4.seed.poisonphang.com:26656"
```

_Where `MONIKER` is the preferred moniker you'd like to use on this node._

:::note

Note the usage of the flags and arguments we pass to `docker run` run here:

- `--volume ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor` mounts the folder we created to the `/.unionvisor` folder of the container
- `-it` ensures we are running the container interactively

:::

After the `uniond init` command is done running, you should have a `.unionvisor` folder with the following contents:

<FileTree>

- ~/.unionvisor
- home/
  - config/
    - app.toml
    - client.toml
    - config.toml
    - genesis.json
    - node_key.json
    - priv_validator_key.json
  - data/
    - priv_validator_state.json
- uniond # versions/v0.18.0/uniond

</FileTree>

### Migrating an Existing Node (Optional)

If you have an existing node, either from running the `uniond` image or raw binary - you can migrate it to Unionvisor starting here.

To migrate, you only need to copy over your `uniond` state into the `~/.unionvisor/home` directory - then start Unionvisor normally.

If you have a `uniond` state saved to `~/.union`, you can run the following command.

```sh frame="none"
sudo cp -r ~/.union/* ~/.unionvisor/home
```

Then continue to follow the guide normally.

:::note

We use `sudo` here because Docker created the files we are copying with elevated permissions.

:::

### Issuing Sub-Commands to uniond via Unionvisor

To run `uniond` sub-commands, it will be useful to alias the Docker command in your shell `.*rc` file.

For example, in `zsh`, you can add the following alias to your `.zshrc`:

```sh frame="none"
alias uniond='docker run -v ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor -v /tmp:/tmp --network host -it ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-6:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION --log-level off call --'
```

_Where `UNIONVISOR_VERSION` is <Version chainId="union-testnet-6" genesis="false"/>_

:::note

- The `unionvisor call` sub-command passes commands and arguments to `uniond`.
- You may wish to pass `--log-level off` when calling Unionvisor to prevent extra output while issuing sub-commands.

:::

This will enable you to issue `uniond` sub-commands with such as `uniond keys add` with ease.

### Starting the Node

To run a node using Unionvisor, you'll also need to expose ports to the container. We'll use this as an opportunity to create a Docker Compose file four Unionvisor.

A minimal Docker Compose file for Unionvisor looks like this:

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: ghcr.io/unionlabs/bundle-testnet-6:$UNIONVISOR_VERSION
    volumes:
      - ~/.unionvisor:/.unionvisor
      - /tmp:/tmp
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: run --poll-interval 1000
```

This will mount our chain configuration and settings folder while also exposing ports `26657`, `1317`, and `9093`.

After creating a `compose.yml` file with the contents above, you'll be able to start your Union node with `docker compose`.

:::warning

Before starting your Union node for the first time, you should configure your node correctly.

For some configuration recommendations see our [Node Configuration](/docs/infrastructure/node-operators/node-configuration) page.

:::

To run your node in detached mode, run:

```sh frame="none"
docker compose --file path/to/compose.yaml up --detach
```
