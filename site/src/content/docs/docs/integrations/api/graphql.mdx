Unionlabs provides a hosted indexing service for all connected chains, served at [graphql.union.build](https://graphql.union.build/v1/graphql). 
A [UI](https://cloud.hasura.io/public/graphiql?endpoint=https://graphql.union.build/v1/graphql) is also provided, which can be used 
to explore all available data. This guide goes through the most useful queries and types.

Although most HTTP clients can be used to query our API, we recommend [URQL](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/). Our GraphQL schema can
be downloaded using [`graphqurl`](https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl) or [`graphql-inspector`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/inspector):

```bash title="introspecting the schema"
export npm_config_yes=true

# using graphqurl
npx graphqurl https://graphql.union.build/v1/graphql \
  --introspect > schema.graphql

# some clients require a JSON schema
npx graphqurl https://graphql.union.build/v1/graphql \
  --introspect \
  --format json > schema.json

# using graphql-inspector
npx @graphql-inspector/cli \
  introspect https://graphql.union.build/v1/graphql \
  --write schema.graphql
```

This schema can be used by API clients and editors like VSCode to provide a better developer experience.

## Concepts

The following definitions are used across the schema and documentation:

- `source`: The chain or rollup where the packet is sent from, often prefixed such as `source_timestamp` or `source_transaction_hash`.
- `destination`: The chain or roll-up that receives the packet. 
- `sender`: the contract or [EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) that made the transfer.
- `receiver`: the contract or [EOA](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/) that received the transfer.

## Queries

Below we have documented some common useful queries that are also leveraged in [app.union.build](https://app.union.build). For all queries, Union
provides caches to increase performance. Use the syntax `@cached(ttl: ${time_in_seconds})` to cache the query. The cache key, which is used 
to map the query to the response, is computed by hashing:

- the GraphQL query.
- the GraphQL operation name.
- the GraphQL variables of the query.

Caching can dramatically improve performance. Always add at least `@cached(ttl: 1)` to cache data between different windows, tabs, or users.

### Transfers

Transfers facilitated by Union (either `ucs01-relay-1` or `ics20-1`) are queryable using v1_transfers.

```graphql
query GetLatest10Transfers @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_transfers(
    limit: 10,
    order_by: { source_timestamp: desc }
  ) {
    tokens {
      denom
      amount
    }
	  sender
	  receiver
  }
}
```

It provides information on the sender, receiver, current stage of the transfer, and asset metadata.

To query for specific addresses, add the `sender` and `receiver` to the where clause:

```graphql
query GetAllUserTransfers @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_transfers(
    order_by: { source_timestamp: desc }, 
    where: {
      _or: [
        { sender: { _eq: "union1sw44hacrewvkuvm70zfxhwa9u6vm4f8yc8spqu" }},  
        { receiver: { _eq: "union1sw44hacrewvkuvm70zfxhwa9u6vm4f8yc8spqu" }}
      ]
    }
  ) {
    tokens {
      denom
      amount
    }
    receiver
    sender
    source_chain { display_name }
    destination_chain { display_name }
  }
}

```
Aggregate statistics about all transfers and packets are also available, such as the total amount of transfers and packets:

```graphql
query {
 	v1_statistics {
    name
    value
  }
}
```

### Packets

Packets, used in general message passing, can be tracked using v1_packets, similar to v1_transfers.

```graphql
query GetLatest10Packets @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_packets(
    limit: 10,
    order_by: { source_timestamp: desc }
  ) {
    source_chain { display_name }
    destination_chain { display_name }
		source_packet_hex
		source_sequence
    destination_sequence
  }
}
```

### Traces

Both transfers and packets come with traces to track the progress of the message. There are four different trace types:

- `SEND_PACKET`
- `LIGHTCLIENT_UPDATE`
- `RECEIVE_PACKET`
- `ACKNOWLEDGE_PACKET`

For a specific transaction hash, you can obtain all traces of transfers and packets caused by this transaction (the `initiating_transaction_hash`) by querying

```graphql
query GetTracesByHash @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_traces(
    where: {
      initiating_transaction_hash: {
        _eq: "91C934788FD13D5325F5A1D9CF1634D1861E318D6DDD2C141E91CBE8A68A053D"
      }
    }
  ) {
    type
    data
	  transaction_hash
    chain { display_name }
  }
}
```

The `v1_traces.data` field is dependent on the type and may contain chain-specific information as well. The `v1_transfers` and `v1_packets` 
also have a relation to traces, to allow for all info of a specific transfer or packet.

```graphql
query GetLatest10TransfersWithTraces @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_transfers(
    limit: 10,
    order_by: {
      source_timestamp: desc
    }
  ) {
    tokens {
      denom
      amount
    }
    receiver
    sender
    traces {
      type
      data
      transaction_hash
      chain { display_name }
    }
  }
}
```

### Assets

Unionlabs provides a curated registry of different assets across different chains, including the bridged asset info for Union's assets. 

```graphql
query GetAllSupportedAssets @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_assets {
    chain {
      display_name
    }
    denom
    decimals
    display_name
    display_symbol
    logo_uri
  }
}
```

The assets can also be grouped and filtered by specific chains.

```graphql
query GetAllSupportedAssetsByChain @cached(ttl: 1) {
  v1_chains {
    chain_id
    assets {
      decimals
      denom
      display_name
      display_symbol
      gas_token
      logo_uri
    }
  }
}
```

## Pagination

Each model has a maximum number of rows that will be returned per query. Prefer using `timestamp` or `source_timestamp` as cursors when paginating.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are dynamically applied depending on traffic and abuse detection. If you require increased privilege to datasets and waived rate limits, contact us [here](mailto:cor@union.build)
