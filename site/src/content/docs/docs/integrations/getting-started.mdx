Opening a connection to Union is fully permissionless for any network with a supported light client. For new 
ecosystems, a light client can be deployed permissionlessly soon, until then a governance proposal is necessary.

The process for opening a connection is different depending on the ecosystem that initiates the handshake. 
We provide a few guides for common SDKs, such as Cosmos, Arbitrum, Movementlabs.xyz, and L2s using Ethereum as a settlement layer. 
The documentation for most of these is a work in progress.

For smart contracts and applications deployed on existing ecosystems, it is best to leverage the pre-existing, 
immutable Union Gateway contracts. These allow for general message passing and asset transfers.

Unionlabs offers a curated [API](/docs/integrations/api/graphql/) and different SDKs to build applications and frontends.
