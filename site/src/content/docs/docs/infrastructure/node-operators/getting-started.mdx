This guide is intended for validators running on bare-metal servers and explains how Union releases work. Check out the [NixOS](/docs/infrastructure/node-operators/nixos/) and the [Kubernetes](/docs/infrastructure/node-operators/kubernetes/) guide for more production-ready deployments.

Validators are the backbone of the network. Becoming one requires significant token bonding and delegations, and is not intended for non-power users.

## Obtaining uniond

:::note

Currently, directly downloading the `uniond` binary requires access to our private GitHub repository. We are not currently providing the general public access to our GitHub repositories.

If you don't have access to our private GitHub repository, you can still run our node using the public Docker image.

:::

You can obtain `uniond` from a recent [release](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/releases/latest).

:::caution

Double-check the version and architecture in the link before downloading.

:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label='x86_64-linux'>
    ```sh frame='none'
    curl --output uniond --location https://github.com/unionlabs/union/releases/download/$UNIOND_VERSION/uniond-release-x86_64-linux
    ```
    *Where `UNIOND_VERSION` is <FunctionResult result={chainVersion({chainId: 'union-testnet-8'}).current} />*

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label='aarch64-linux'>
    ```sh frame='none'
    curl --output uniond --location https://github.com/unionlabs/union/releases/download/$UNIOND_VERSION/uniond-release-aarch64-linux
    ```
    *Where `UNIOND_VERSION` is <FunctionResult result={chainVersion({chainId: 'union-testnet-8'}).current} />*

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify that the binary works on your server by running:

```sh frame="none"
./uniond --help
```

For convenience, we can add the binary to the `PATH`, to make it callable from anywhere.

```sh frame="none"
mv ./uniond /usr/bin/
```

### Using Docker

We also provide containers in our [package registry](https://github.com/orgs/unionlabs/packages/container/package/uniond-release).

```sh frame="none"
docker pull ghcr.io/unionlabs/uniond-release:$UNIOND_VERSION
```

_Where `UNIOND_VERSION` is <FunctionResult result={chainVersion({chainId: 'union-testnet-8'}).current} />_

When running the container, make sure to map a volume to the path passed in `--home` options to ensure data persistence. From here on the guide assumes the usage of a regular binary. The [docker-compose](/docs/infrastructure/node-operators/docker-compose/) section is more suited for docker users.

:::caution

`uniond` is a stateful application and interacts with the file system. Make sure to use [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/).

:::

## Initialization

We'll need to set up a few configuration files and obtain the <DownloadFile filepath="/genesis.json" filename="genesis.json" /> before we can run the node.

First, set some environment variables, which are used throughout initialization.

<Code
  lang='bash'
  code={dedent(`
    export CHAIN_ID=union-testnet-8
    export MONIKER="Unionized Goblin"
    export KEY_NAME=alice
    export GENESIS_URL="https://union.build/genesis.json"
  `)}
/>


Then we'll have `uniond` initialize our data and configuration directories. By default, `/User/{USER}/.uniond` is used.

```sh frame="none"
uniond init $MONIKER --chain-id $CHAIN_ID
```

### Seeds

Next, edit `~/.union/config/config.toml`. We'll set the seeds to ensure your node can connect to the peer-to-peer network.

For `union-testnet-8` replace `seeds = ""` with:

<Code
  lang='toml'
  code={`seeds = "${chainVersion({ chainId: 'union-testnet-8' }).seeds}"`} 
/>


### Genesis Configuration

Download the `genesis.json` and copy it to your `uniond` home directory.

```sh frame="none"
curl $GENESIS_URL | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.union/config/genesis.json
```

### Registration

To join as a validator, you need to submit a registration transaction. You can do this from the command line on your validator node.

First, add a wallet that holds Union tokens.

```sh frame="none"
uniond keys add $KEY_NAME --recover
```

:::caution

For production usage, we recommend not storing the wallet on a server.

:::

To submit the registration transaction and become a validator, you must submit a `create-validator` transaction:

```sh frame="none"
uniond tx staking create-validator \
  --amount 1000000muno \
  --pubkey $(uniond tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker $MONIKER \
  --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
  --from $KEY_NAME \
  --commission-max-change-rate "0.1" \
  --commission-max-rate "0.20" \
  --commission-rate "0.1" \
  --min-self-delegation "1"
```

:::note

If your own node isn't set up to accept RPC request, you can send them to another node via the `--node` option.

:::

## Systemd Service

We recommend running `uniond` as a systemd service. Create a file in `/etc/systemd/system` called `uniond.service`. Make sure to replace $USER with your username.

```toml frame="none"
[Unit]
Description=uniond
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
User=$USER
ExecStart=/usr/bin/uniond start

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

You should be able to view the node logs by executing

```sh frame="none"
sudo journalctl -f --user uniond
```

It's then recommended to back up these files from `~/.union/config` in a secure location:

- `priv_validator_key.json`
- `node_key.json`
