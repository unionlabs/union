This guide assumes you are familiar with running a Union validator. If not, start with the [validator guide](../getting-started).

[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for running containers in a declarative manner. This allows for better automation, upgrades, and monitoring.

## Configuration

Our base `compose.yml` is fairly simple:

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: "ghcr.io/unionlabs/uniond-release:$UNIOND_VERSION"
    volumes:
      - ~/.union:/.union
      - /tmp:/tmp
    network_mode: "host"
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: start --home /.union
```

Pay special attention to the `volumes` key. Here we map an already initialized `~/.uniond` directory to the `node` service. The `~/.uniond` directory should contain a `config` and `data` directory. To properly set these up, check out the [validator guide](../getting-started).

## Monitoring

We suggest adding additional monitoring services, such as [datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).
