## Resource Naming Conventions

Imagine you have a resource `Block` that you fetch from the api, want to store globally, and have a component that displays it nicely. The naming would be as follows:

- The `Schema` is called `Block` and stored in `src/lib/schemas/block.ts`
- The query is called `blockQuery` and stored in `src/lib/queries/block.ts`
- The `Store` class is called `BlockStore` and stored in `src/lib/stores/block.svelte.ts`
- The concrete instance of `BlockStore` is called `block`
- The component displaying blocks is called `BlockComponent` and stored in `src/lib/components/data/block-component.svelte`

## UI Components Naming Conventions

A `Button` would go in `src/lib/components/ui/button/index.svelte`

## How to add an icon

1. Go to https://icones.js.org/collection/ic?s=sharp
2. Click on the item you want
3. Click the Components > Svelte button
4. Add it to `src/lib/components/icons`, `ic:sharp-bannana` becomes `SharpBannanaIcon.svelte`
