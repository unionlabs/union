A basic implementation of a client for the [Ethereum Beacon API][beacon-api].

This library currently only provides the minimal interfaces required to fetch updates for our [ethereum light client](light-clients/ethereum-light-client/README.md). Adding support for more endpoints is currently low priority, bu we welcome contributions to add additional functionality!
