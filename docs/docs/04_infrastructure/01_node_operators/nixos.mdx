NixOS deployments can use our [module](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/blob/82ad5ef76b42e76a18617a614c1cdcd41d1fbe93/unionvisor/unionvisor.nix#L68) to easily manage their validator. It creates a systemd service with a production configuration

:::caution
The current example does not support remote signers yet. We will expand the guide once [horcrux](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/horcrux) support is implemented.

## Configuration

Below is an example configuration.nix which can be used in production.

:::caution
The example currently uses `git+ssh://` syntax rather than `github:` syntax because our repository is not public yet. Once it is, this will be simplified. When this happens, `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE` will also no longer be required.
:::

import Configuration from "!!raw-loader!../../../../unionvisor/usage.nix";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

<CodeBlock language="nix">{Configuration}</CodeBlock>

You can then deploy the configuration by running

```sh
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#testnet-validator --target-host user@validator.domain -L
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade to newer versions, simply run

```sh
nix flake update
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#testnet-validator --target-host user@validator.domain -L
```

This will pull in the latest changes to union configurations and prepare your node for future upgrades.
