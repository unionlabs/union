# Testnet Onboarding

This section will guide you through creating a node in the Union Testnet and becoming a validator.

## The Onboarding Process

To conduct the onboarding process, follow the steps below:

### 0) Initialize and configure your node

To initialize and start your node, you can either manually run/extract [`uniond`](./01_obtaining_uniond.md) from the `uniond` docker image, or you can run [Unionvisor](./06_unionvisor.md), our node supervisor.

### 1) Fill out our intake form

You'll need to follow our instructions from the [Getting Testnet Tokens](./02_getting_tokens.md) page to get the information required to fill out our intake form. Once you have the information ready - continue to filling out our [Validator Intake Form](https://7xv16fh3twz.typeform.com/to/eYTMvi11).

### 2) Receive UNO and Create your validator

Once we've processed your intake form, you'll have enough UNO to [Create a Validator](./creating_validators).

### 3) Receive a full delegation from a member of the founding team

After we see your validator is created, we'll delegate more to your node to ensure you get a chance at producing blocks.

### 4) Ensure you are creating blocks correctly

Once we see that you've produced blocks for 24 hours, you will have completed the onboarding process. You will receive a notification from us confirming the completion of your onboarding.

## State Sync

If the network has undergone a binary upgrade or has produced many blocks since genesis, you may find joining with [State Sync](./state_sync) to be easiest.

## Public Endpoints

We also maintain a list of [Public Endpoints](./public_endpoints).
