# Testnet Onboarding

This section will guide you through creating a node in the Union Testnet and becoming a validator.

## The Onboarding Process

To conduct the onboarding process, follow the steps below:

### 0) Initialize and configure your node

Follow the instructions from our [Obtaining the uniond Binary](./01_obtaining_uniond.md) page to initialize your node and begin interacting with `uniond`.

### 1) Fill out our intake form

You'll need to follow our instructions from the [Getting Testnet Tokens](./02_getting_tokens.md) page to get the information required to fill out our intake form.

### 2) Receive UNO and Create your validator

Once we've processed your intake form, you'll have enough UNO to [Create a Validator](./creating_validators).

### 3) Receive a full delegation from a member of the founding team

After we see your validator is created, we'll delegate more to your node to ensure you get a chance at producing blocks.

### 4) Ensure you are creating blocks correctly

Once we see that you've produced blocks for a day, you will have completed the onboarding process.
