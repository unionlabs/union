# Overview

`ucs01-relay-1` is an evm compatible, multihop protocol leveraging [packet-forward middleware](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-apps/tree/main/middleware/packet-forward-middleware) (PFM).
A transfer is decomposed into two smaller transfers, and routed through the middleware to the appropriate chain using the `channel` and `port` combination. `ucs01-relay-1` is only supported
for transfers, as it leverages the memo field to encode routing data. 


## Protocol

<Mermaid

    critical   
        Chain A ->> Union: ClientUpdate
        Chain A ->> Union: Packet
        Union ->> Chain B: ClientUpdate
        Union ->> Chain B: Packet
    end 
    Chain B ->> Union: ClientUpdate
    Chain B ->> Union: Acknowledgement
    Union ->> Chain A: ClientUpdate
    Union ->> Chain A: Acknowledgement
`}/>

After the `critical` section in the diagram has been completed, the transfer portion for the user is completed, and funds become transferrable on the destination chain. 

### Routing

The memo field of the transfer must contain a JSON object with a `forward` key, which specifies the `port` and `channel` to forward into.

```json
{
  "forward": {
    "port": 5,
    "channel": 30,
    "recipient": "0x..."
  }
}
```

On Union, the `PFM` middleware will create a new transfer with a new sequence number using the routing info.
