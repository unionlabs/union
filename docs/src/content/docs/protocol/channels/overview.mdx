### Identifier

Each channel has a `connection-id` and `channel-id`, uniquely identifying the channel on that specific chain. Note that these identifiers
are not globally unique, such that two chains can both have channels with IDs `(10, 2)`. This does not mean that, since the IDs
are the same, these channels are connected to each other.

### Status

A channel goes through different states referred to as status: `INIT`, `TRY`, `ACK`, and `CONFIRM`. Unless you 
are opening channels yourself, you only need to concern yourself with the `CONFIRM` state, which means the channel 
can now relay messages and assets.

### version

Channels serve different protocol types, indicated by their `version`. These can be fully custom, although most of the 
time they will be one of the enshrined types (such as [`ucs03-zkgm-1`](/protocol/channels/ucs03-zkgm)). In other cases,
they can be fully custom, like

```json
{
  "version": "ics27-1",
  "controller_connection_id": "connection-0",
  "host_connection_id": "connection-28",
  "address": "union1k8c7ks99ltx3gu4rejhm9jxj0cu4ukpg3s2dcqfwawr7d5k3xh0qzl9eag",
  "encoding": "proto3",
  "tx_type": "sdk_multi_msg"
}
```

Which was created by the [ICA](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/app/ics-027-interchain-accounts) module. Custom
versions should only be used if you created the channel or have a deep understanding of the protocol.
