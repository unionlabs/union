If your chain is not yet [connected to Union](/protocol/chains/overview/), then you can permissionlessly add support. Union supports L1s, L2s, L3s, and Rollups. The steps to connect are simple:

<Steps>
1. Upload `ibc-union` and `light-client` contracts

    This means deploying and initializing both the [`ibc-union`](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/ab76fd72e114a2b8db8ad469dc587aec865e2095/cosmwasm/ibc-union/core) contract and the respective light clients for the chain you're trying to connect.
    Union maintains both Solidity and CosmWasm implementations of `ibc-union`.
    You will then need to deploy the CometBLS light client on your chain as well as the respective light client of your chain on Union.
    Union has implementations the following [light clients](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/tree/main/cosmwasm/ibc-union/light-clients):
    - Arbitrum (CosmWasm)
    - Berachain (CosmWasm)
    - CometBLS (Solidity, CosmWasm)
    - Ethereum (CosmWasm)
    - Linea (CosmWasm)
    - Movement (CosmWasm)
    - Scroll (CosmWasm)
    - Tendermint (a.k.a. CometBFT) (CosmWasm)

2. Configure the [Voyager](/architecture/voyager/overview) relayer

    You'll need to either use or create a Voyager instance that supports your relaying needs.

3. Open the connection

    With Voyager and the contracts in place, you can begin the connection ceremony. Assuming Voyager is tracking both Union and your chain, you will only need to send a `connection_open_init` message to accomplish this.

    If Voyager is not already tracking both chains, you will need to submit the remainder of the connection ceremony messages.

4. Open a channel

    With a connection established, you will need to open a channel on the connection before sending messages between Union and your chain.

5. Send assets and data

    With a channel open, you can now send assets and data between chains. Start by manually submitting transfer messages or see our other connect tutorials to send assets or data with your own apps.
