This tutorial will walk you through creating a smart contract to send assets with Union. Asset transfer can be achieved through the message passing exposed by ZKGM (aka ucs03-zkgm).

At this point, you can continue the tutorial with either our [CosmWasm](/connect/app/asset-transfer/cosmwasm) or [Solidity](/connect/app/asset-transfer/solidity) specific tutorials.
