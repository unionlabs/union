## Proof of Authority

Rather than PoS, Union testnet 10 will have the validator set managed by proof of authority (POA). **Users will be unable to conduct normal staking and delegation actions**. Notably, UNO (`muno`) will not be used for staking as this is entirely managed by the POA module created by Strangelove.

## Fee Market

To increase network stability, a fee market has been introduced. This adds dynamic fee rates to transactions on the network. For end-users, this means that each transaction will need to include a non-zero fee.
