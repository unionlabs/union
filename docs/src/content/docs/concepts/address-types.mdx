title: Address Types
---

There are various ways to encode and represent addresses. This is how we Union defines them throughout the APIs and implementations:

## Any Ecosystem

```
CanonicalBytes<N> = Uint8Array of length N
```

## Cosmos


```
Cosmos<Hrp> = {
  Canonical = CanonicalBytes<20 | 32 | N>
  Display = Bech32<Hrp, Cosmos.Canonical>
  Zkgm = Bech32<Hrp, Cosmos.Canonical>
}
```

:::note
So far we've only encountered `CanonicalBytes<20>` and `CanonicalBytes<32>`. Cosmos is highly customizable however, so we recommend against making this assumption
:::

## EVM

```
Evm = {
  Canonical = CanonicalBytes<20>
  Display = Checksum<Hex<Evm.Canonical>>
  Zkgm = Evm.Canonical
}
```

## Aptos

```
Aptos = {
  Canonical = CanonicalBytes<32>
  Display = Hex<Aptos.Canonical>
  Zkgm = Aptos.Canonical
}
```


## GraphQL encoding

Responses from our [GraphQL API](/integrations/api/graphql) are encoded as follows:

```
transfers {
  sender_canonical: Hex<Chain.Canonical>
  sender_display: Chain.Display
  sender_zkgm: Hex<Chain.Zkgm>
  receiver_canonical: Hex<Chain.Canonical>
  receiver_display: Chain.Display
  receiver_zkgm: Hex<Chain.Zkgm>
}
```


## TypeScript-SDK encoding

### CosmWasm

```
receiver: Hex<DestinationChain.Zkgm>
```

### EVM
```
receiver: Hex<DestinationChain.Zkgm>
```

### Aptos
```
receiver: Hex<DestinationChain.Zkgm>
```
