# Union App 1

[app.union.build](https://app.union.build) is built to be user friendly, extremely reliable, and blazing fast. It achieves this through a stack of optimized tools that do most processing at compile time (before you even use the app), and by connecting to our optimized [hubble](../hubble) indexer over our GraphQL API.

## Quickstart

Run the following to start a development server, once it's running edit the files in `app/` and you'll see your changes reflected immediately in the browser.

```
nix run .#app-dev-server
```

To fetch the latest [GraphQL] schema, run

```
nix run .#app-fetch-schema
```

## Architecture

It's a [SvelteKit] app that compiles to a static site such that it can later be distributed using decentralized providers like [IPFS].
Data is fetched from [graphql.union.build]. The [GraphQL] queries are defined in `./src/lib/graphql/documents`, and types for it are generated by [gql.tada]. We use [TanStack Query] to periodically fetch new data (both for [GraphQL] and REST).

For interacting with EVM chains, we use [Wagmi & Viem](https://wagmi.sh/core/getting-started). For interacting with Cosmos chains, we use [CosmJS].

The basis for our components are generated by [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com), and then modified to adhere to our brand guidelines. Styling is done using [Tailwind].

_We're currently migrating from Svelte 4 to Svelte 5_

### How to fix npm install errors on x86_64-linux

```
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm update # <- important part, this ignores aarch64-only cache.
# update npmDepsHash in app.nix
```
